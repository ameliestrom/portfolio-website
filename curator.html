        <p>Problem Statement: Upcoming artists, and creatives are normally struggling in the beginning of their career with the question, how? How do I market my own work?
          How do I find ways for new people to view my work? How do I invite people to my exhibitions? As there’s an astounding amount of upcoming artists available from various cultures, excited to share their own artwork, there’s a space needed to
          find them to be able to explore your own creativity, motivation, or simply, your own way of relaxing, and rewinding.</p>
        <p>Solution: The Curator is an app concept aimed for anyone who wants to share their own creativity. Newcoming artists are able to market their own artwork, and upcoming exhibitions by using The Curator. The app is aimed for art enthusiasts
          as well who want to explore new, and upcoming art exhibitions in their homecity, or while they are traveling. Users are also able to purchase art, and support artists who are sharing their talent on The Curator.</p>

            <h3>Recap</h3>
            <p>As I am personally very interested in exploring new art exhibitions, this project was very exciting to design. I was able to put myself into the shoes of the user in a different way as this is a app I would want to use myself. The
              competitive analysis was very interesting to research as there weren’t a lot of options in terms of art exhibition locater apps. This made the analysis even more important as there weren’t a wide variety of comparisons available to
              make.
              The process was very smooth which I believe was due to my planning from early on in the project. I set up my design process from the beginning, and knew the steps I wanted to take, and what I wanted to complete for tasks. Furthermore, I
              learnt about designing for Android on another level, which I really appreciate. I was able to take time to study the Material Design Guidelines, and interview Android users who helped me understand the difference in more detail.</p>
